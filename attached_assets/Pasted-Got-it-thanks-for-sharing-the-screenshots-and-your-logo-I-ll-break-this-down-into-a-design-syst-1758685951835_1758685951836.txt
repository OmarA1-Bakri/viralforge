Got it — thanks for sharing the screenshots and your logo. I’ll break this down into a **design system proposal** that aligns the dark UI of your app with your logo’s cyan + pink palette, while making the whole interface more consistent and modern.

---

### 🎨 Color Palette (Dark Theme + Accents)

* **Backgrounds**

  * Primary: `#0E0E0E` (deep charcoal black, avoids flat pure black)
  * Secondary panels/cards: `#1A1A1A` (slightly lighter for separation)
  * Dividers/lines: `#2A2A2A` (low-contrast greys to keep it sleek)

* **Typography**

  * Primary text: `#FFFFFF` (white, 90% opacity for readability)
  * Secondary text: `#A0A0A0` (soft grey, avoids too much contrast)

* **Accents (from logo)**

  * Cyan: `#4EE2E8` (used for highlights, links, progress bars)
  * Pink: `#FF5DBB` (used for key actions like buttons, trending badges)
  * Supporting Neutral: `#2D2D2D` (hover states, card borders)

* **States**

  * Success: `#4EE2E8` (cyan doubles as a positive/success marker)
  * Warning: `#FFC857` (warm yellow, minimal use)
  * Error: `#FF5C70` (soft red that pairs well with pink)

### 🔘 Component Styling

* **Cards / Panels**

  * Background: `#1A1A1A`
  * Rounded corners: `12px`
  * Shadow: subtle cyan/pink glow for hover states

* **Buttons**

  * Primary CTA: Gradient blend `linear-gradient(135deg, #4EE2E8, #FF5DBB)`
  * Secondary: Solid `#2D2D2D` with white text
  * Hover: Slight scale + glow matching cyan/pink

* **Icons & Highlights**

  * Use cyan (`#4EE2E8`) for interactive icons
  * Use pink (`#FF5DBB`) for "hot" or "trending" badges
  * Keep all other icons in monochrome white/grey

---

### 📊 Dashboard Alignment

Looking at your current app:

* **Stats (Views, Likes, CTR, etc.)**

  * Replace the current teal/green accent with cyan (`#4EE2E8`) consistently
  * Use pink (`#FF5DBB`) only for highlighting **growth/positive trends**
  * Keep % change badges in colored pills with softer background:

    * +positive = Cyan pill (`#132D2E` bg, cyan text)
    * -negative = Pink pill (`#2E1427` bg, pink text)

* **Performance Insights**

  * Instead of green highlights → use **cyan** (aligned with success)
  * Trending hashtags: pill badge with cyan border + pink text inside

---

### ✨ Example Mappings

* Current "Hot" (orange) badge → **Pink (`#FF5DBB`)**
* Current "Rising" (yellow) badge → **Cyan (`#4EE2E8`)**
* Current green "Performance insights" pill → **Cyan**

---

### 🌐 Overall Vibe

This keeps the **dark pro UI**, but applies your **logo’s cyan + pink identity** across highlights, badges, and CTAs. The app will feel:

* Sleek (black + grey base)
* Energetic (cyan for active/highlight)
* Playful but modern (pink for momentum/trending)

👉 Do you want me to **mock this into a visual theme guide** (hex palette + component preview) so you can hand it straight to your devs/designers?
