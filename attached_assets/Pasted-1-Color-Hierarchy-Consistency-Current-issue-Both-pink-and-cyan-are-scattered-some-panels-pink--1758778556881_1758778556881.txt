1. Color Hierarchy & Consistency

Current issue: Both pink and cyan are scattered (some panels pink, some cyan, some default grey/blue).

Refine:

Use cyan as the primary accent (for active states, highlights, progress bars).

Use pink as the secondary accent (for CTAs, emphasis, “hot/trending” badges).

Keep neutral greys consistent for inactive/secondary states.

➡ Example:

Sidebar/tab highlight = cyan

Active button/focus = cyan glow

“Hot/Trending” = pink pill badge

Errors = muted pink/red variant

2. Typography & Spacing

Current issue: Font weights, sizes, and spacings vary, which makes panels feel slightly disjointed.

Refine:

Titles: Semibold, 16–18px, consistent color (white at 90%).

Metrics: Bold, 20–24px, accented with cyan/pink, but always in the same typographic style.

Sub-labels: Regular, 12–14px, grey (#A0A0A0).

Line-height: Increase by ~10% to create air between blocks.

3. Component Shapes & Shadows

Current issue: Some panels have a flat look, others faint shadows — not unified.

Refine:

All cards: Rounded corners (12px).

Shadow: very subtle cyan or pink glow on hover (0, 0, 12px, accent color at 20% opacity).

Flat but layered: Ensure consistent panel backgrounds (#1A1A1A for cards, #0E0E0E for app background).

4. Navigation Bar

Current issue: Pink glow under active tab is heavy compared to the rest.

Refine:

Use underline or subtle pill highlight in cyan for active tab.

Keep icons monochrome white; add cyan glow on hover, pink only for emphasis.

Balance spacing so all items align cleanly.

5. Micro-interactions

Right now everything is static. Adding subtle motion makes it feel alive and premium:

Hover → accent glow + scale up 2–3%.

Tab change → smooth 150–200ms slide or fade.

Progress bar → cyan gradient animation.

6. Logo Integration

Your logo is cyan + pink split. Right now the app uses both but without tying back.

Refine:

Use a cyan→pink diagonal gradient (like your logo) selectively:

On CTAs (primary buttons, “Process” etc.)

On active metrics or “AI Effectiveness” progress bars

Keep gradients rare so they pop instead of overwhelm.

🎨 Visual Example System

Primary Accent: #4EE2E8 (cyan)

Secondary Accent: #FF5DBB (pink)

Background: #0E0E0E

Card Panels: #1A1A1A

Typography:

White (90%) #EAEAEA

Secondary Grey #A0A0A0

➡ Rule of Thumb: Cyan = default highlight, Pink = emphasis/trend, White = clarity, Grey = support.
