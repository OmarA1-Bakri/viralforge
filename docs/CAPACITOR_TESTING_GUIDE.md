# Capacitor App Testing Guide - ViralForge AI

## Understanding Your App Architecture

ViralForge AI is a **Capacitor hybrid app**:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript web app
- **Backend**: Express.js API server
- **Mobile Wrapper**: Capacitor (native WebView container)
- **Not** a native Android app with Camera Kit or TensorFlow

## Step 1: Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed
2. Android Studio with Android SDK
3. Physical Android device (recommended) or emulator
4. Backend server running

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build web assets
npm run build

# Sync to Android
npx cap sync android

# Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

## Step 2: Running the App

### Option A: Development with Live Reload (Recommended)

1. **Start Full-Stack Dev Server**
```bash
# This single command starts the Express backend and Vite frontend with live reload
npm run dev
```

2. **Configure Capacitor for Dev Server**

For live reload to work, you need to point Capacitor to your computer's local IP address. Use the mobile development script:

```bash
./mobile-dev.sh android
```

Alternatively, you can manually edit `capacitor.config.ts` and add:

```typescript
// capacitor.config.ts - Add during development only
server: {
  url: 'http://192.168.1.X:5173', // Replace X with your local IP
  cleartext: true
}
```

3. **Run in Android Studio**
- Select your device/emulator
- Click Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- App will load from dev server with hot reload

### Option B: Production Build Testing

```bash
# Build production assets
npm run build

# Sync to Android
npx cap sync android

# Open and run in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

## Step 4: Debugging Tools & Techniques

### Chrome DevTools (Recommended)

**Connect to WebView:**

2. Connect device via USB
3. Open Chrome: `chrome://inspect`
4. Click "inspect" under your app
5. Full access to React DevTools, Console, Network tab

**Debugging Steps:**
```javascript
// Add debug logs
console.log('API response:', data);
console.error('Error occurred:', error);

// Check network requests
// Use Network tab in Chrome DevTools

// Inspect React components
// Use React DevTools extension
```

### Logcat (Native Logs)

**Filter for Your App:**
```bash
# All logs
adb logcat

# Filter by package
adb logcat | grep "com.viralforge.ai"

# Filter by tag
adb logcat -s CapacitorPlugin
adb logcat -s Capacitor

# Clear logs first
adb logcat -c
```

**Common Error Patterns:**
- `FATAL EXCEPTION` - App crash
- `ANR` - App Not Responding
- `E/` - Error logs
- `W/` - Warning logs

### Android Studio Profiler

**Monitor Performance:**
1. Run app from Android Studio
2. Open Profiler (View ‚Üí Tool Windows ‚Üí Profiler)
3. Monitor:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory allocation
   - Network activity
   - Battery usage

## Step 5: Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: White Screen on Launch

**Causes:**
- Build not synced
- API server not running
- WebView error

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Rebuild and sync
npm run build
npx cap sync android

# Check Chrome inspect for console errors
# Start backend server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: API Calls Fail

**Causes:**
- CORS issues
- Backend not running
- Wrong API URL
- Network security config

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check API is accessible
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Verify network security config
# android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml
```

### Issue: Camera Not Working

**Causes:**
- Permissions not granted
- Plugin not synced
- Emulator limitations

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
# Test on real device
# Re-sync Capacitor
npx cap sync android
```

### Issue: Biometric Auth Fails

**Causes:**
- No biometric enrolled on device
- Plugin not configured
- Emulator doesn't support biometrics

**Solutions:**
- Test on real device with enrolled biometrics
- Check plugin installation
- Implement fallback to password

### Issue: Build Fails

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Clean build
cd android
./gradlew clean

# Invalidate caches in Android Studio
# File ‚Üí Invalidate Caches / Restart

# Re-sync Capacitor
npx cap sync android
```

## Step 6: Pre-Release Testing

### Release Build Testing

```bash
# Build release AAB
npm run build
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Test release build
# Extract universal APK from AAB
bundletool build-apks --bundle=app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --output=app-release.apks --mode=universal

# Install and test
adb install -r app-release.apks
```

### Critical Pre-Launch Checks

- [ ] All API endpoints use HTTPS in production
- [ ] API keys secured (not in git)
- [ ] Debug logs removed/disabled
- [ ] Analytics configured correctly
- [ ] ProGuard rules tested
- [ ] No console.log in production
- [ ] Error tracking setup (Sentry)
- [ ] Privacy policy accessible
- [ ] Terms of service accessible

## Step 7: Test Automation (Future)

### E2E Testing with Playwright

```bash
# Install Playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test

# Run tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Unit Testing

```bash
# Run Jest tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
