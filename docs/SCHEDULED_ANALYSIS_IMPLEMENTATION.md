# Scheduled Analysis System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete scheduled profile analysis system for Creator tier users, allowing automatic analysis execution at configurable intervals (daily/weekly/monthly).

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
**Table**: `analysis_schedules`
- `id` - Primary key
- `user_id` - Foreign key to users table
- `frequency` - Analysis frequency (manual/daily/weekly/monthly)
- `scheduled_day_of_week` - Day of week for weekly schedules (0-6)
- `scheduled_day_of_month` - Day of month for monthly schedules (1-31)
- `scheduled_time` - Time of day to run (HH:MM format)
- `last_run_at` - Timestamp of last execution
- `next_run_at` - Timestamp of next scheduled execution
- `is_active` - Boolean flag for active schedules
- `created_at` - Record creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Record update timestamp

**Migration**: `server/db/migrations/add_analysis_schedules.sql`

### 2. Backend API Routes
**File**: `server/routes/schedule.ts`

#### GET `/api/profile/schedule`
- Retrieves current schedule for authenticated user
- Returns schedule details + analyses count for today (max 5/day limit)
- Response format:
```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "frequency": "daily",
    "scheduledDate": null,
    "scheduledTime": "09:00",
    "nextRun": "2025-10-08T08:00:00.000Z",
    "isActive": true
  },
  "analysesToday": 9
}
```

#### POST `/api/profile/schedule`
- Creates or updates schedule for authenticated user
- Validates frequency and time format
- Calculates next_run_at based on frequency
- Request body:
```json
{
  "frequency": "daily",
  "scheduledDate": null,
  "scheduledTime": "09:00"
}
```

#### DELETE `/api/profile/schedule`
- Deletes schedule for authenticated user
- Returns success confirmation

### 3. Cron Job Scheduler
**File**: `server/automation/analysis-scheduler.ts`

**Key Features**:
- Runs every 5 minutes to check for due schedules
- Processes all schedules where `next_run_at <= now` and `is_active = true`
- Calculates next run time BEFORE attempting analysis (prevents infinite loops)
- Uses try/catch/finally to ensure schedule always updates even if analysis fails
- Weekly cleanup job runs Sundays at 2 AM to remove stale schedules (6+ months old)

**Critical Fix Applied**:
- Schedule update logic moved to `finally` block
- Prevents infinite retry loops when analysis fails (e.g., rate limits)
- Ensures `next_run_at` always advances to next scheduled time

**Calculation Logic**:
- **Daily**: Next day at scheduled time
- **Weekly**: Next week on same day at scheduled time
- **Monthly**: Next month on same date at scheduled time (handles month overflow)

### 4. Frontend Component
**File**: `client/src/components/ScheduledAnalysisSettings.tsx`

**Features**:
- Frequency selector (Manual/Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
- Date picker for weekly/monthly schedules
- Time picker (24-hour format, displays in 12-hour)
- Current schedule display showing:
  - Frequency
  - Next run time
  - Analyses today counter (X / 5)
- Save and Delete buttons with loading states

**Critical Fix Applied**:
- Properly destructured API response to access nested schedule object
- Changed from `data: schedule` to `data`, then extracted `schedule = data?.schedule`
- Fixed display of frequency, next run time, and analyses count

### 5. Integration
**Files Modified**:
- `server/index.ts` - Started analysis scheduler on server boot
- `server/routes.ts` - Registered schedule routes
- `client/src/pages/UserPreferences.tsx` - Added Schedule tab
- `@shared/schema.ts` - Added analysisSchedules table schema

## Testing & Verification

### Database Tests
- ✅ Schedule creation and updates working
- ✅ `next_run_at` calculated correctly for all frequencies
- ✅ `last_run_at` updated after execution

### API Tests
- ✅ GET endpoint returns correct nested structure
- ✅ POST endpoint validates and saves schedules
- ✅ DELETE endpoint removes schedules
- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints

### Scheduler Tests
- ✅ Cron job runs every 5 minutes
- ✅ Due schedules processed correctly
- ✅ Schedule updates even when analysis fails
- ✅ No infinite retry loops

### Frontend Tests
- ✅ Schedule saves successfully
- ✅ Current schedule displays after save
- ✅ Frequency, next run, and analyses today all visible
- ✅ UI updates after refetch

## Production Readiness

### Security
- ✅ All endpoints require authentication (`requireAuth` middleware)
- ✅ User can only access their own schedule
- ✅ Input validation on frequency and time format

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing profiles
- ✅ Deactivates schedule if profile doesn't exist
- ✅ Logs all errors with context
- ✅ Database updates in finally block to prevent deadlocks

### Performance
- ✅ Indexed queries on `user_id` and `next_run_at`
- ✅ Efficient batch processing of due schedules
- ✅ Cleanup job prevents unbounded table growth

### Monitoring
- ✅ Structured logging with pino
- ✅ Logs scheduler startup
- ✅ Logs each schedule execution with success/failure
- ✅ Debug logs for "no due schedules" state

## Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Creator tier has 5 analyses/day limit enforced in background job service
2. **Timezone**: All times stored in UTC, frontend displays in local timezone
3. **Concurrency**: Single cron instance, no distributed locking (acceptable for current scale)
4. **Month Overflow**: Monthly schedules on day 29-31 may shift to last day of shorter months

## Future Enhancements

1. Add email notifications when scheduled analysis completes
2. Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed analyses
3. Add schedule pause/resume functionality
4. Add timezone selection in UI
5. Add analysis history view showing all scheduled executions

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `server/db/migrations/add_analysis_schedules.sql`
- `server/routes/schedule.ts`
- `server/automation/analysis-scheduler.ts`
- `client/src/components/ScheduledAnalysisSettings.tsx`
- `test-schedule-api.ts` (test utility)
- `check-schedule-update.ts` (test utility)

### Modified Files
- `server/index.ts`
- `server/routes.ts`
- `client/src/pages/UserPreferences.tsx`

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: Run `add_analysis_schedules.sql` before deploying
2. **Server Restart**: Required to start the cron scheduler
3. **Frontend Build**: Rebuild and redeploy client assets
4. **Verification**: Check logs for "✅ Analysis scheduler started" message

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Schedule saves to database
- ✅ Schedule displays in UI
- ✅ Cron job executes on schedule
- ✅ Analysis jobs created successfully
- ✅ Schedule advances to next run time
- ✅ No infinite loops or stuck schedules
