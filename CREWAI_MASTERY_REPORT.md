# 1. Key to Writing Effective CrewAI Agent Prompts

## 1.1 The Three Pillars of Agent Definition

Every effective CrewAI agent MUST have three core attributes that work together:

### **Role** (Identity)
- **Purpose**: Defines the agent's function and expertise
- **Best Practice**: Use specific, professional job titles
- **Length**: 1-5 words maximum
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ GOOD: "Senior Research Specialist", "YouTube Trend Scout", "Data Analyst and Report Writer"
  - ❌ BAD: "Helper", "Agent", "AI Assistant"

### **Goal** (Objective)
- **Purpose**: Individual objective that guides decision-making and task prioritization
- **Best Practice**: Make it specific, measurable, and action-oriented
- **Length**: 1-2 sentences
- **Structure**: `[Action Verb] + [What] + [Constraint/Context]`
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ GOOD: "Discover trending YouTube videos, viral patterns, and emerging opportunities on the YouTube platform"
  - ✅ GOOD: "Analyze research findings and create comprehensive reports using data-driven insights"
  - ❌ BAD: "Help with research", "Do good work", "Assist users"

### **Backstory** (Context & Personality)
- **Purpose**: Provides context, expertise depth, and personality to shape agent behavior
- **Best Practice**: Include experience level, domain expertise, methodology, and unique capabilities
- **Length**: 3-6 sentences
- **Components**:
  1. **Experience Level**: "You are an expert...", "You are an elite...", "You have 10+ years..."
  2. **Domain Knowledge**: Specific skills, frameworks, or methodologies
  3. **Approach/Methodology**: How the agent works
  4. **Unique Capabilities**: What makes this agent special

**Example of Excellent Backstory**:
```yaml
backstory: >
  You are an expert YouTube trend analyst with deep knowledge of the YouTube
  algorithm and viral video patterns. You can analyze trending channels, identify
  viral formats before they saturate, and spot gaps in popular niches. You understand
  thumbnail psychology, title formulas, and retention tactics that make videos explode
  on YouTube's recommendation system. You've studied thousands of viral videos and
  can identify patterns that predict success.
```

**Example of Poor Backstory**:
```yaml
backstory: >
  You are a helpful assistant who likes to research things.
```

## 1.2 Advanced Agent Configuration Parameters

### **Critical Configuration Options**

```yaml
agent_name:
  role: "Specific Professional Title"
  goal: "Action-oriented objective with constraints"
  backstory: "Detailed expertise, methodology, and capabilities"

  # Performance Controls
  verbose: true                    # Enable for debugging
  allow_delegation: false          # Enable for coordinator agents only
  max_iter: 3                      # Maximum task attempts (3-5 recommended)
  max_retry_limit: 2               # Retry attempts on failure

  # Memory & Learning
  memory: true                     # Enable learning from past executions

  # Context Management
  respect_context_window: true     # Auto-manage conversation limits

  # Advanced Features (optional)
  reasoning: true                  # Enable reflection before execution
  llm: "provider/model-name"       # Specific LLM override
```

### **When to Enable Delegation**

✅ **Enable `allow_delegation: true` for**:
- **Coordinator/Manager agents**: Agents that oversee workflows
- **Research directors**: Agents that need to distribute sub-tasks
- **Project managers**: Agents coordinating multiple specialists

❌ **Disable `allow_delegation: false` for**:
- **Specialized executors**: Agents with narrow, specific tasks
- **Final reviewers**: Agents that validate/approve work
- **Simple task agents**: Agents with straightforward objectives

---

## 1.3 Task Prompt Engineering

### **The Four Pillars of Task Definition**

#### **1. Description** (What & How)
- Detailed instructions on what the agent should do
- Use numbered lists for multi-step processes
- Include specific constraints and requirements
- Reference available tools explicitly
- Use variables like `{topic}` or `{niches}` for dynamic inputs

**Structure Template**:
```yaml
description: >
  [Primary objective for {variable}]

  Your analysis should include:
  1. [Specific requirement 1]
  2. [Specific requirement 2]
  3. [Specific requirement 3]
  4. [Specific requirement 4]
  5. [Specific requirement 5]

  [Additional constraints or guidance]
  [Tool usage instructions if applicable]
```

#### **2. Expected Output** (Format & Structure)
- Define EXACT deliverable format
- Use structured formats (bullet points, sections, templates)
- Specify minimum requirements (e.g., "Top 10...", "At least 5...")
- Include quality criteria

**Examples**:

✅ **GOOD Expected Output**:
```yaml
expected_output: >
  Comprehensive YouTube trend analysis report with:
  - Top 10 trending video topics with performance metrics
  - 5 viral content patterns currently working
  - 3 untapped opportunities or content gaps
  - Recommended content angles and formats
```

❌ **BAD Expected Output**:
```yaml
expected_output: >
  A report about the trends
```

#### **3. Agent Assignment**
```yaml
agent: agent_name  # Must match agent key in agents.yaml
```

#### **4. Context** (Task Dependencies)
```yaml
context:
  - previous_task_name    # Output becomes available to this task
  - another_task_name     # Creates sequential dependency chain
```

---

## 1.4 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ **Agent Definition Pitfalls**

1. **Vague Roles**
   - Bad: "Helper", "Assistant", "Worker"
   - Good: "Senior Research Analyst", "Content Optimization Specialist"

2. **Generic Goals**
   - Bad: "Help with tasks", "Do good work"
   - Good: "Analyze retention patterns and provide algorithm-optimized recommendations"

3. **Weak Backstories**
   - Bad: "You are helpful and knowledgeable"
   - Good: "You are a data-driven YouTube analyst specializing in retention analysis, CTR optimization, and algorithmic patterns..."

4. **Missing Tool References**
   - Bad: Not mentioning available tools in backstory
   - Good: "You have access to YouTubeVideoSearchTool for semantic search within transcripts"

5. **No Methodology**
   - Bad: Just stating expertise
   - Good: Including HOW the agent approaches problems

### ❌ **Task Definition Pitfalls**

1. **Ambiguous Descriptions**
   - Bad: "Research the topic"
   - Good: "Conduct thorough research on {topic} including: 1. Historical context, 2. Current trends, 3. Future predictions"

2. **Unstructured Expected Output**
   - Bad: "Give me a report"
   - Good: "Provide a report with: Executive Summary (200 words), Key Findings (5 bullet points), Recommendations (3 actionable items)"

3. **Missing Context Dependencies**
   - Bad: Task expects previous task output but doesn't declare it
   - Good: Explicitly list all required context tasks

4. **No Quality Criteria**
   - Bad: No way to measure success
   - Good: "Each recommendation must include 3+ supporting examples with data"

---

## 1.5 Excellent vs Poor Prompt Examples

### **Example 1: Research Agent**

#### ❌ POOR EXAMPLE
```yaml
researcher:
  role: "Researcher"
  goal: "Do research"
  backstory: "You are good at research"
  verbose: true
```

#### ✅ EXCELLENT EXAMPLE
```yaml
researcher:
  role: "Senior Research Specialist"
  goal: "Conduct comprehensive research on assigned topics, extracting key insights and validating information from multiple authoritative sources"
  backstory: >
    You are an experienced research specialist with expertise in academic research,
    fact-checking, and information synthesis. You have access to advanced search tools
    and databases. Your methodology involves: 1) Identifying authoritative sources,
    2) Cross-referencing information, 3) Extracting key insights, 4) Validating claims
    with evidence. You're known for thorough, accurate research that provides actionable
    intelligence for decision-makers.
  verbose: true

  agent: researcher
```

---

## 1.6 Tool Integration in Prompts

### **Best Practice: Reference Tools in Backstory**

When agents have access to tools, explicitly mention them in the backstory with usage guidance:

```yaml
trend_scout:
  role: "YouTube Trend Scout"
  goal: "Discover trending YouTube videos and viral opportunities"
  backstory: >
    You are an expert YouTube trend analyst with deep knowledge of viral patterns.

    TOOLS AT YOUR DISPOSAL:
    - YoutubeVideoSearchTool: Use for semantic search within specific video transcripts
    - YoutubeChannelSearchTool: Use to analyze patterns across entire channels

    METHODOLOGY:
    1. Search top-performing channels in target niche
    2. Analyze their last 10 viral videos using video search tool
    3. Extract common patterns in hooks, titles, thumbnails
    4. Identify content gaps and opportunities
  tools:
    - YoutubeVideoSearchTool
    - YoutubeChannelSearchTool
```

### **Task-Level Tool Guidance**

```yaml
discover_trends:
  description: >
    Discover trending YouTube content for {niches}.

    STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
    1. Use YoutubeChannelSearchTool to find top 5 channels per niche
    2. Use YoutubeVideoSearchTool to analyze their last 10 viral videos
    3. Extract patterns: titles, thumbnails, hooks, retention tactics
    4. Identify content gaps: high search volume, low competition

    Use the YouTube RAG tools to perform semantic searches within videos.
  expected_output: >
    YouTube trend analysis with specific video examples and data
  agent: trend_scout
  tools:
    - YoutubeVideoSearchTool
    - YoutubeChannelSearchTool
```

---

## 1.7 Knowledge Source Integration

### **Enhancing Agents with Domain Knowledge**

CrewAI supports knowledge sources (text, PDF, CSV, web content) to ground agent responses in factual information.

**Best Practice**:
```python
from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource

# Load knowledge
knowledge_sources = []
knowledge_files = ['viral_patterns.md', 'youtube_algorithm.md']

for filename in knowledge_files:
    with open(f'knowledge/{filename}', 'r') as f:
        knowledge_sources.append(
            StringKnowledgeSource(
                content=f.read(),
                metadata={"source": filename}
            )
        )

# Reference in agent backstory
backstory: >
  You have access to viral_patterns.md containing proven viral formulas.
  Reference specific patterns from the knowledge base when making recommendations.
```

**Mention knowledge in prompts**:
```yaml
backstory: >
  You are an expert with access to:
  - viral_patterns.md: 50+ proven viral content patterns
  - youtube_algorithm.md: YouTube recommendation system documentation

  Always cite specific patterns from the knowledge base in your analysis.
```

# 2. Ultra-Effective Agent Strategy Plan

## 2.1 Agent Design Principles

### **Principle 1: Single Responsibility**
Each agent should have ONE clear, well-defined purpose.

❌ **Bad**: "Research agent that also writes content and publishes it"
✅ **Good**: Separate agents for Research → Writing → Publishing

### **Principle 2: Complementary Expertise**
Design agents with non-overlapping, complementary skills.

**Example Team Structure**:
```
1. TrendScout → Discovers opportunities
2. ContentAnalyzer → Analyzes patterns
3. ContentCreator → Creates content
4. PublishManager → Optimizes distribution
5. PerformanceTracker → Monitors results
```

### **Principle 3: Clear Hierarchies**
Establish clear workflows and dependencies.

```yaml
Sequential Workflow:
  discover_trends → analyze_performance → create_content → optimize_content → plan_publication → track_performance
```

### **Principle 4: Explicit Tool Assignment**
Only give agents the tools they actually need.

```yaml
researcher:
  tools: [SerperDevTool, WebsiteSearchTool]  # Search tools only

writer:
  tools: [FileWriterTool]  # Writing tools only

publisher:
  tools: [FileWriterTool, CalendarTool]  # Publishing tools only
```

### **Principle 5: Measurable Outputs**
Every agent should produce clearly defined, measurable outputs.

```yaml
expected_output: >
  JSON object containing:
  - trend_score: integer 1-10
  - viral_potential: percentage
  - recommended_action: string
  - supporting_evidence: array of URLs
```

---

## 2.2 Task Decomposition Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Functional Decomposition**

Break down complex objectives into functional steps:

```
Goal: Create viral YouTube content

Decomposition:
1. discover_trends → Find what's working
2. analyze_performance → Understand why it works
3. create_content → Generate new content based on insights
4. optimize_content → Refine for maximum viral potential
5. plan_publication → Schedule and distribute strategically
6. track_performance → Monitor and iterate
```

### **Strategy 2: Data Flow Decomposition**

Organize tasks based on data transformation:

```
Input Data → Processing → Output Data

Raw Research → Analysis → Insights
Insights → Content Creation → Draft Content
Draft Content → Optimization → Final Content
Final Content → Publication → Published Content
Published Content → Tracking → Performance Metrics
```

### **Strategy 3: Parallel vs Sequential**

**Use Sequential for**:
- Tasks with clear dependencies
- Linear workflows
- When next step needs previous output

**Use Parallel (async) for**:
- Independent research tasks
- Concurrent data gathering
- Multiple platform operations

```python
# Sequential
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task, writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Parallel (async tasks)
research_task_1 = Task(..., async_execution=True)
research_task_2 = Task(..., async_execution=True)
research_task_3 = Task(..., async_execution=True)
```

### **Strategy 4: Context Passing**

Use task context to pass information efficiently:

```yaml
task_1:
  description: "Research {topic}"
  expected_output: "Research findings"
  agent: researcher

task_2:
  description: "Analyze the research findings"
  expected_output: "Analysis report"
  agent: analyst
  context:
    - task_1  # Automatically receives task_1 output

task_3:
  description: "Create content based on analysis"
  expected_output: "Content draft"
  agent: writer
  context:
    - task_1  # Gets research
    - task_2  # Gets analysis
```

---

## 2.3 Inter-Agent Communication Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Delegation (Coordinator → Specialist)**

**When to use**: Manager agent coordinating specialist agents

```yaml
coordinator:
  role: "Project Coordinator"
  allow_delegation: true  # ← Enable delegation
  goal: "Coordinate team efforts to achieve project goals"

specialist_1:
  role: "Research Specialist"
  allow_delegation: false  # ← Specialists don't delegate

specialist_2:
  role: "Writing Specialist"
  allow_delegation: false
```

**Process**: Hierarchical
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[coordinator, specialist_1, specialist_2],
    tasks=[complex_task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm="gpt-4o"  # Manager handles delegation
)
```

### **Pattern 2: Sequential Handoff**

**When to use**: Assembly line workflows

```yaml
Task 1 (Agent A) → Output A
Task 2 (Agent B) → Uses Output A → Output B
Task 3 (Agent C) → Uses Output B → Output C
```

### **Pattern 3: Collaborative Single Task**

**When to use**: Multiple agents working together on one task

```python
collaborative_task = Task(
    description="Complex task requiring multiple perspectives",
    expected_output="Comprehensive result",
    agent=None,  # Will be distributed
    context=[]
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    tasks=[collaborative_task],
    process=Process.hierarchical  # Manager coordinates
)
```

### **Pattern 4: Question-Answer**

Agents can ask questions to teammates:

```yaml
agent_with_questions:
  role: "Analyst"
  backstory: >
    When you need clarification, use the question-asking tool
    to request information from specialized teammates.
```

---

## 2.4 Memory and Context Management

### **Memory Types**

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    memory=True,  # Enables all memory types
    verbose=True
)
```

**1. Short-Term Memory**
- Stores recent interactions using RAG
- Uses ChromaDB
- Ideal for: Maintaining conversation context

**2. Long-Term Memory**
- Preserves insights from past executions
- Uses SQLite3
- Ideal for: Learning from historical data

**3. Entity Memory**
- Tracks information about specific entities
- RAG-based
- Ideal for: Remembering facts about people, companies, products

**4. Contextual Memory**
- Combines all memory types
- Provides coherent, informed interactions

### **Memory Configuration**

```python
# Agent-level memory
agent = Agent(
    role="Analyst",
    memory=True,  # Agent-specific memory
    ...
)

# Crew-level memory
crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    memory=True,  # Shared crew memory
)
```

### **External Memory (Advanced)**

```python
from crewai.memory.storage import ExternalMemory

external_memory = ExternalMemory(
    embedder_config={
        "provider": "mem0",
        "config": {
            "user_id": "unique_user_id",
        }
    }
)
```

### **Context Window Management**

```yaml
agent_name:
  respect_context_window: true  # Auto-manages conversation limits
```

---

## 2.5 Error Handling and Fallback Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Retry Logic**

```yaml
agent_name:
  max_iter: 3          # Maximum attempts
  max_retry_limit: 2   # Retry on failure
```

### **Pattern 2: Human-in-the-Loop**

```yaml
critical_task:
  description: "Make important decision"
  expected_output: "Decision with justification"
  agent: decision_maker
  human_input: true  # ← Requires human approval
```

### **Pattern 3: Validation Guards**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ResearchOutput(BaseModel):
    findings: str = Field(..., min_length=100)
    sources: list = Field(..., min_items=5)
    confidence_score: float = Field(..., ge=0.0, le=1.0)

research_task = Task(
    description="Research topic",
    expected_output="Validated research findings",
    output_pydantic=ResearchOutput  # ← Validates output structure
)
```

### **Pattern 4: Fallback Chains**

```python
# Primary agent
primary_agent = Agent(llm="gpt-4o", ...)

# Fallback agent with simpler model
fallback_agent = Agent(llm="gpt-4o-mini", ...)

# Implement try-except at crew level
try:
    result = crew_with_primary.kickoff()
except Exception:
    result = crew_with_fallback.kickoff()
```

---

## 2.6 Performance Optimization Techniques

### **1. Choose Appropriate LLMs**

```yaml
# Fast tasks → Cheaper models
simple_agent:
  llm: "gpt-4o-mini"

# Complex reasoning → Advanced models
complex_agent:
  llm: "gpt-4o"
```

### **2. Enable Caching**

```python
from crewai.tools import tool

@tool("search_tool")
def search(query: str) -> str:
    # Tool automatically caches results
    return perform_search(query)
```

### **3. Use Async Execution**

```python
# Parallel task execution
task_1 = Task(..., async_execution=True)
task_2 = Task(..., async_execution=True)
task_3 = Task(..., async_execution=True)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[task_1, task_2, task_3]
)

# Or async kickoff
result = await crew.kickoff_async()
```

### **4. Limit Iterations**

```yaml
agent_name:
  max_iter: 3  # Don't let agents loop indefinitely
```

### **5. Streaming Responses**

```python
llm = LLM(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    stream=True  # Stream responses for faster perceived performance
)
```

### **6. Optimize Context**

```python
# Don't pass unnecessary context
task_3:
  context:
    - task_2  # Only what's needed, not task_1 if irrelevant
```

---

## 2.7 Testing and Quality Assurance

### **Built-in Testing Command**

```bash
# Test with default settings (2 iterations, gpt-4o-mini)
crewai test

# Custom test
crewai test --n_iterations 5 --model gpt-4o
```

### **Performance Metrics**

CrewAI tests evaluate:
- **Task scores**: 1-10 scale per task

## 3.7 Testing Strategy

### **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] **Unit Test Individual Agents**:
  ```python
  # Test agent can be instantiated
  agent = Agent(config=agent_config)
  assert agent.role == "Expected Role"
  ```

- [ ] **Test Task Definitions**:
  ```python
  # Verify task configuration
  task = Task(config=task_config, agent=agent)
  assert task.description is not None
  ```

- [ ] **Integration Test Crew**:
  ```bash
  # Run built-in tests
  crewai test --n_iterations 3
  ```

- [ ] **Test with Sample Inputs**:
  ```python
  inputs = {"topic": "test topic"}
  result = crew.kickoff(inputs=inputs)
  assert result is not None
  ```

- [ ] **Measure Performance**:
  ```python
  import time
  start = time.time()
  result = crew.kickoff(inputs=test_inputs)
  duration = time.time() - start
  print(f"Execution time: {duration}s")
  ```

- [ ] **Validate Outputs**:
  ```python
  # Check output structure
  assert "expected_key" in result.raw
  assert len(result.raw) > 100  # Minimum length
  ```

- [ ] **Error Handling Tests**:
  ```python
  # Test with invalid inputs
  try:
      result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": ""})
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Handled error: {e}")
  ```

## 3.8 Production Deployment Considerations

### **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] **Environment Configuration**:
  - [ ] All API keys stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)
  - [ ] `.env` file added to `.gitignore`
  - [ ] Environment-specific configs (dev/staging/prod)

- [ ] **Error Handling**:
  - [ ] Try-except blocks around crew.kickoff()
  - [ ] Logging configured for errors
  - [ ] Retry logic for transient failures
  - [ ] Graceful degradation when services unavailable

- [ ] **Monitoring**:
  - [ ] Log crew execution times
  - [ ] Track API usage and costs
  - [ ] Monitor success/failure rates
  - [ ] Set up alerts for failures

- [ ] **Performance**:
  - [ ] Disable verbose mode: `verbose: false`
  - [ ] Optimize LLM choices (use cheaper models where possible)
  - [ ] Enable caching for tools
  - [ ] Use async execution for parallel tasks

- [ ] **Security**:
  - [ ] API keys rotated regularly
  - [ ] Input validation/sanitization
  - [ ] Output sanitization (remove sensitive data)
  - [ ] Rate limiting for API calls

- [ ] **Testing**:
  - [ ] Comprehensive test suite passing
  - [ ] Load testing completed
  - [ ] Edge cases handled
  - [ ] Rollback plan in place

- [ ] **Documentation**:
  - [ ] README with setup instructions
  - [ ] API documentation if exposing endpoints
  - [ ] Architecture diagram
  - [ ] Runbook for common issues

### **Deployment Process**

```bash
# 1. Final tests
crewai test --n_iterations 5

# 2. Build/package
# (depends on deployment target)

# 3. Deploy
# (depends on platform: Docker, serverless, etc.)

# 4. Verify
crewai run  # Test in production environment

# 5. Monitor
# Check logs, metrics, alerts
```

## 3.9 Quick Reference: Common Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Research → Analyze → Create Workflow**

```yaml
# agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: "Senior Research Specialist"
  goal: "Conduct comprehensive research"
  tools: [SerperDevTool, WebsiteSearchTool]

analyst:
  role: "Data Analyst"
  goal: "Analyze research findings"
  tools: []

creator:
  role: "Content Creator"
  goal: "Create content based on insights"
  tools: [FileWriterTool]

# tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: "Research {topic}"
  agent: researcher

analyze_task:
  description: "Analyze research findings"
  agent: analyst
  context: [research_task]

create_task:
  description: "Create content"
  agent: creator
  context: [research_task, analyze_task]
  output_file: "output/content.md"
```

### **Pattern 2: Parallel Research + Sequential Analysis**

```yaml
# tasks.yaml
research_source_1:
  description: "Research from source 1"
  agent: researcher_1
  async_execution: true  # Run in parallel

research_source_2:
  description: "Research from source 2"
  agent: researcher_2
  async_execution: true  # Run in parallel

synthesize:
  description: "Synthesize all research"
  agent: analyst
  context: [research_source_1, research_source_2]  # Waits for both
```

### **Pattern 3: Human-in-the-Loop Approval**

```yaml
draft_content:
  description: "Create content draft"
  agent: writer

review_content:
  description: "Review draft for quality"
  agent: reviewer
  context: [draft_content]
  human_input: true  # ← Requires human approval

publish_content:
  description: "Publish approved content"
  agent: publisher
  context: [review_content]  # Only runs if approved
```

### **Effective Tasks = Clear Instructions + Structured Output + Proper Context**

✅ **Instructions (Description)**:
- Step-by-step process
- Specific requirements
- Tool usage guidance
- Quality criteria

✅ **Output Specification (Expected Output)**:
- Exact format
- Minimum requirements
- Success criteria
- Structure template

✅ **Dependencies (Context)**:
- List all required previous tasks
- Create logical workflow chains

## Final Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 2-3 agents and basic tasks. Add complexity incrementally.

2. **Use YAML Configuration**: More maintainable than code-based definitions.

3. **Test Early and Often**: Use `crewai test` to validate before deploying.

4. **Leverage Knowledge**: Ground agents in domain-specific knowledge sources.

5. **Monitor Performance**: Track execution times, costs, and success rates.

6. **Iterate Based on Results**: Refine prompts based on actual agent behavior.

7. **Document Everything**: Maintain clear documentation of agent roles, tasks, and workflows.

8. **Security First**: Never hardcode API keys, always use environment variables.

9. **Plan for Failure**: Implement retry logic, error handling, and fallbacks.

10. **Optimize Costs**: Use cheaper models for simple tasks, advanced models only when necessary.
