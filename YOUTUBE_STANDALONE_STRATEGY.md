# YouTube Standalone Branch - Strategy & Roadmap

**Branch**: `youtube-standalone`
**Created**: October 8, 2025
**Purpose**: Build data-validated, YouTube-optimized viral scoring rubric

---

## üéØ Strategic Focus

This branch focuses **exclusively on YouTube** to:

1. **Validate scoring weights** with real data before multi-platform expansion
2. **Optimize for YouTube's algorithm** (thumbnails, retention, CTR)
3. **Build credibility** with one platform done right vs. three done poorly
4. **Reduce complexity** - master one ecosystem first

---

## üìä Data-Driven Approach

### Current State (from `main` branch)
- **Weights**: Invented, not validated
- **Platform**: Generic (YouTube/TikTok/Instagram)
- **Evidence**: Rubric documentation from user research

### YouTube Standalone Goals
- **Weights**: Validated against 250+ YouTube videos
- **Platform**: YouTube-specific optimization
- **Evidence**: 3-LLM research synthesis + empirical testing

---

## üî¨ Research Foundation

### Multi-LLM Validation Strategy
User is building comprehensive knowledge base from:
1. **LLM #1**: Pattern analysis from viral YouTube videos
2. **LLM #2**: Algorithm mechanics and ranking factors
3. **LLM #3**: Creator success stories and failure patterns

### Expected Weight Adjustments (Hypothesis)

**Current Weights** (generic):
```
Production Quality: 20%
Content Value: 25%
Engagement: 20%
Algorithm Optimization: 15%
Uniqueness: 10%
Niche Fit: 10%
```

**YouTube-Optimized Weights** (hypothesis from research):
```
Algorithm Optimization: 30%  ‚Üë (Thumbnail + Title = click decision)
Engagement: 25%              ‚Üë (Watch time = ranking factor)
Content Value: 20%           ‚Üì (Quality ‚â† virality)
Uniqueness: 12%              ‚Üë (Novelty drives shares)
Production Quality: 10%      ‚Üì (Good enough > perfect)
Niche Fit: 3%                ‚Üì (Breaking niche = broader reach)
```

**Rationale**:
- **YouTube algorithm prioritizes**: CTR (thumbnail/title) + Retention (engagement)
- **Production quality**: Diminishing returns after "good enough"
- **Niche fit**: Can limit viral potential to existing audience

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: YouTube-Specific Rubric (Week 1)
- [ ] Update `viral-scoring-rubric-v2.ts` with YouTube weights
- [ ] Add YouTube-specific checks:
  - [ ] Thumbnail contrast analyzer
  - [ ] Title keyword optimizer
  - [ ] Retention curve estimator
  - [ ] Chapter/timestamp optimization
- [ ] Remove TikTok/Instagram platform options
- [ ] Update validation tests for YouTube-only

### Phase 2: Data Collection & Validation (Week 2)
- [ ] Build YouTube video scraper using YouTube MCP tools
- [ ] Collect stratified sample:
  - [ ] 10 videos: Tier S (95-100 score)
  - [ ] 50 videos: Tier A (85-94 score)
  - [ ] 50 videos: Tier B (75-84 score)
  - [ ] 50 videos: Tier C (65-74 score)
  - [ ] 50 videos: Tier D (50-64 score)
  - [ ] 40 videos: Tier F (<50 score)
- [ ] Manual scoring of all 250 videos
- [ ] Correlation analysis: predicted vs. actual viral success

### Phase 3: Weight Optimization (Week 3)
- [ ] Run regression analysis on collected data
- [ ] Compare current weights vs. optimal weights
- [ ] A/B test with 50 users (v2.0 vs. YouTube-optimized)
- [ ] Iterate based on prediction accuracy

### Phase 4: YouTube-Specific Features (Week 4)
- [ ] Shorts vs. Long-form detection
- [ ] Chapter optimization scoring
- [ ] End screen effectiveness
- [ ] Card placement recommendations
- [ ] Community post integration

## üéì YouTube-Specific Insights (from Research)

### Algorithm Factors (by importance)
1. **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: 35% of ranking
   - Thumbnail quality
   - Title curiosity gap
   - Topic relevance to audience

2. **Average View Duration (AVD)**: 30% of ranking
   - Hook strength (first 30 seconds)
   - Pacing (cuts, visual interest)
   - Payoff delivery

3. **Engagement Rate**: 20% of ranking
   - Likes, comments, shares
   - Replay rate
   - Add to playlist

4. **Session Time**: 10% of ranking
   - Does video lead to more YouTube watching?
   - End screen clicks
   - Suggested video clicks

5. **Upload Consistency**: 5% of ranking
   - Regular upload schedule
   - Channel authority

### Red Flags (YouTube-Specific)
- **Clickbait mismatch**: Thumbnail/title doesn't match content (-15 pts)
- **Long intro**: >30 seconds before value (-10 pts)
- **Poor audio**: Viewer exits immediately (-8 pts)
- **Low resolution**: <1080p on desktop content (-5 pts)
- **No end screen**: Missed session time opportunity (-3 pts)

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Week 1-2: Research & Build
- Implement YouTube-optimized rubric
- Build data collection pipeline

### Week 3-4: Validate
- Collect 250 video sample
- Validate weights with regression
- A/B test with users

### Week 5: Launch
- Deploy to 100% of YouTube users
- Monitor accuracy metrics
- Iterate based on feedback

### Week 6+: Expand
- Once YouTube validated (>70% accuracy), create branches for:
  - `tiktok-standalone` (different weights, different factors)
  - `instagram-reels-standalone` (hybrid approach)

## üìù Notes for Future Me

### Why YouTube First?
- **Largest platform**: Biggest user base for validation
- **Best data**: YouTube API provides rich metrics
- **Clearest algorithm**: More documented than TikTok/Instagram
- **Monetization focus**: Creators care most about YouTube revenue

### What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå Don't force multi-platform too early
- ‚ùå Don't use same weights for all platforms
- ‚ùå Don't skip data validation step
- ‚ùå Don't optimize for content quality when users want virality

### What TO Do
- ‚úÖ Master one platform before expanding
- ‚úÖ Validate every assumption with data
- ‚úÖ Test with real users continuously
- ‚úÖ Iterate based on prediction accuracy, not opinions
