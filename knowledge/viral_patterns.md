# Viral Content Patterns & Psychology

## Core Viral Mechanics

### Hook Patterns That Work
1. **Problem-Solution Hook**: "I tried every X until I found this one thing..."
2. **Transformation Hook**: "Before vs After" formats
3. **Secret/Behind-the-scenes**: "What they don't tell you about..."
4. **Controversy Hook**: "Everyone does X wrong. Here's the right way..."
5. **Story Hook**: "The day that changed everything..."
6. **Question Hook**: "What would you do if..."
7. **List Hook**: "5 things that will blow your mind..."

### Engagement Triggers
- **Curiosity Gap**: Create incomplete information that demands completion
- **Social Proof**: Show others engaging (likes, comments, shares)
- **FOMO**: Time-sensitive or exclusive information
- **Controversy**: Polarizing opinions that spark debate
- **Relatability**: Universal experiences everyone recognizes
- **Surprise**: Unexpected twists or outcomes
- **Emotional High**: Joy, anger, surprise, disgust trigger shares

### Content Structure Formulas

#### The Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS) Formula
1. Identify a relatable problem

2. Show desired future state
3. Bridge the gap with your solution
