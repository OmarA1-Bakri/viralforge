    Discover trending YouTube content and viral opportunities for the following niches: {niches}.

    STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
    1. Use YoutubeChannelSearchTool to identify the top 5-10 channels in each niche
       based on subscriber count, recent view performance, and upload consistency
    2. For each top channel, use YoutubeVideoSearchTool to analyze their last 10 videos
       that achieved 500K+ views, extracting:
       - Hook patterns (first 8 seconds): What grabs attention immediately
       - Title formulas: Structure, keywords, emotional triggers, curiosity gaps
       - Thumbnail elements: Visual patterns, faces, text overlays, contrast
       - Content format: Length, pacing, editing style, production value
    3. Cross-reference findings with viral_patterns.md knowledge base to validate
       patterns against proven viral formulas
    4. Identify content gaps: Topics with high search volume but low quality competition
       using semantic search within successful channels to find underserved sub-niches
    5. Extract specific viral opportunities with concrete examples and performance data

    QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
    - Analyze minimum 5 channels per niche (50+ videos total)
    - Provide specific video URLs as evidence for each pattern
    - Include actual performance metrics (views, CTR estimates, engagement rates)
    - Cross-reference at least 3 patterns from viral_patterns.md knowledge base

    Use the YouTube RAG tools to perform semantic searches within video transcripts
    and channel content. Focus on patterns that are currently trending (last 30-90 days)
    but not yet saturated.

    4. OPTIMIZATION TRIGGERS (automated decision rules):
       - Thumbnail/Title Swap Triggers:
         * If CTR < 4% after 6 hours → Swap immediately to variation #2
         * If CTR 4-6% after 24 hours → Test variation #2 after 48 hours
         * If CTR > 8% → Don't change, monitor
       - Ad Boost Triggers:
         * If CTR > 8% AND AVD > 50% at 24 hours → Boost with $50-100
         * If CTR > 10% AND retention > 60% → Boost with $200-300
         * If CTR < 6% → Fix issues before spending
       - Follow-Up Content Triggers:
         * If > 100K views in 7 days → Create part 2 immediately
         * If > 50K views in 14 days → Create related content
         * If engagement rate > 8% → Expand topic into series
       - Metadata Optimization Triggers:
         * If search traffic < 10% at 7 days → Improve description SEO
         * If browse traffic > 60% → Leverage with similar content

    5. A/B TESTING PLAN (systematic experimentation):
       - Week 1-2: Test thumbnail variation #2 if initial CTR < 8%
       - Week 3-4: Test title variation if CTR plateaus
       - Month 2-3: Test different hook styles in similar content
       - Ongoing: Document what works vs what doesn't
       - Testing protocol:
         * Only change ONE variable at a time
         * Measure impact over 7-day periods
         * Document results in performance log

    6. ITERATION STRATEGY (continuous improvement):
       - Pattern Validation:
         * Which viral patterns worked as expected
         * Which patterns underperformed (update knowledge base)
         * New patterns discovered (add to viral_patterns.md)
       - Format Optimization:
         * Best performing video length
         * Optimal pacing and pattern interrupt frequency
         * Most effective thumbnail style for niche
       - Next Video Improvements:
         * Top 3 learnings to apply immediately
         * Top 3 mistakes to avoid
         * Recommended format adjustments
